##  Background

Since the scope of the hackfest is very wide, it is impossible to provide a definitive list of prerequisite knowledge which will satisfy all cases. The hackfest is  **not a training event** - we are coming together to **work** intensively for a few days, in order to get ideas to a workable state and push projects out to the world. This requires that we all come prepared and take a bit of time to brush up on some skills. We provide a few suggestions for self-paced courses, and self-assessment guides in each section.

Ensure that you go through the course checklist before these course prerequisites.

## Collaborating with Code

Open Science has a strong emphasis on transparency and openness, and this includes both the _products_ and the _process_ of scientific collaboration. Central to this paradigm is the ability to easily share and review code, projects and services. We'll be using <span class="devicons devicons devicons-git" style="font-size: 1.25em; vertical-align: center;"></span> git and <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Githu to ensure change control and collaborate effectively.

### Training suggestions

  1. <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/">Git Essentials</a> by <a href="https://www.codeschool.com">CodeSchool.</a>. You will need a Github account
  1. <a href="https://github.github.io/on-demand/intro-to-github/">Introduction to GitHub</a>.
  1. If you're using Windows or Mac, we're sorry - you're missing out on all the fun. But you _do_ get to use the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> application. Take the <a href="https://github.github.io/on-demand/github-desktop/">Github Desktop</a> course


## Programming the web

Whether you are building a small application or a fully-fledged science gateway, it will need to interact with other services on the web. These services will commonly expose a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST API</a></strong>.

### Training suggestions

Apart from understanding the basic premise of what REST is, there is no standard tutorial for REST APIs. During the hackfest, we will be doing warm-up sessions of using the REST APIs of services in the <a href="http://www.sci-gaia.eu/osp">Open Science Platform</a>, but if you want to brush up on your skills we have a few suggested self-paced courses :

  1. See the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/apis">Codecademy list of API tutorials</a> - you may want to choose a ruby, javascript, or python-based tutorial based on your stack.
