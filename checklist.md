## Warm up

In order to participate in the hackfest, you will need to do some preliminary tasks. These are basic things which you likely already have, and will need later in order to collaborate and continue to contribute to both your own project and the wider community. <strong>You must complete this checklist before coming to the hackfest in Lagos</strong>

## On your marks

 These may include completing some of the short prerequisite courses that we think are necessary to work on the projects, as well as to ensure that we have a common grounding. The prerequisites are _elective_, so if you think you already have the skills that these courses provide, feel free to skip them.

## Get Set

Once you have set up your development environment and brushed up on your skills, why not take some time to do background reading on the hackfest. These are _elective_ but will help a lot in order to shape  your questions and plans.
